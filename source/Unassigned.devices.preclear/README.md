**Unassigned Devices Preclear**

This plugin is a utiliity to test and clear disk drives prior to adding them to Unraid's array, or to erase them prior to disposal. It's also a parser for **Joe L.'s** excellent Preclear Disk Script, which also includes a fast post-read verify option, courtesy of **bjp999**.
